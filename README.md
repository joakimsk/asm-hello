# ASM Tests
An attempt at learning some assembly

## Assemble
To assemble the .asm file into hello_world.o using the Mach-O 64bit object file notation format (used by MacOS Mojave)

nasm -f macho64 hello_world.asm

## Linking

Change version to sw_vers output, in my case 10.15.7
Check architecture using uname -a
Use -lSystem 
Use -macosx_version_min 10.15.7

On OS X 11 and higher, use
-L/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib

ld -macosx_version_min 10.15.7 -o hello hello.o -lSystem -L/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib

Use -s to strip the output, removing symbol table

## RIP-relative vs absolute addressing
Mac OS X may not allow absolute addressing. Can be handled in various ways.

Switch -no_pie to disable position independent code, or swap mov to lea

## Structure of program

### data section
Used to declare initialized data, does not change at runtime.
Declared using section.data

### bss section
Used to declare variables.
Declared using section.bss

### text section
Used to keep the actual code, must begin with global _start or global _main depending on switch, tells kernel where to start
section.text
   global _start
_start:

## Syscall
System calls can be called from code, depends on OS/architecture.
See on OS X: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.1.sdk/usr/include/sys/syscall.h

- [linux system calls](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/assembly_system_calls.htm)
- [os x system calls howto 32 vs 64 bit](https://filippo.io/making-system-calls-from-assembly-in-mac-os-x/)
- [os x system calls](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1504.3.12/bsd/kern/syscalls.master)
- [os x system calls](https://jameshfisher.com/2017/01/31/macos-system-calls/)
- [os x 64 bit asm](http://www.idryman.org/blog/2014/12/02/writing-64-bit-assembly-on-mac-os-x/)

For 64 bit, put system call in rax register, you need to add 0x20000000 to the syscall int

Used syscalls:
1	AUE_EXIT	ALL	{ void exit(int rval); }
4	AUE_NULL	ALL	{ user_ssize_t write(int fd, user_addr_t cbuf, user_size_t nbyte); } 

See table [here](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/)

### On 64 bit OS X
We put our syscall function in rdx


We put our arguments in:
- rdi (first argument)
- rsi (second argument)
- rdx (third argument)
- r10, r8, r9 (and so forth)

[using rel in os x 64 bit](http://caswenson.com/2018_02_06_64bit_assembly_language_programming_under_macos_with_nasm.html)

## Check retval of exit
./exit; echo $?

Should return 0 for a correct exit
